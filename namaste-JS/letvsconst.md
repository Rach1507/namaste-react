diff btw 
syntax error
type error 
reference error

Certainly. Let's break down the differences between these three types of errors in JavaScript:

1. Syntax Error:
   - Occurs when the code violates JavaScript's syntax rules.
   - Detected during the parsing phase, before the code is executed.
   - The script will not run at all if there's a syntax error.

2. TypeError:
   - Occurs when an operation is performed on a value of the wrong type.
   - Happens during code execution.
   - Often involves trying to use a value in an inappropriate way.

3. ReferenceError:
   - Occurs when you try to use a variable or function that doesn't exist or is out of scope.
   - Also happens during code execution.
   - Often involves misspelled variable names or accessing variables before they're declared.

Here are examples of each:

```javascript
// Syntax Error
let x = 5;
if (x === 5) {
    console.log("x is 5")  // Missing semicolon
}

// TypeError
let y = 42;
y.toUpperCase();  // Trying to use a string method on a number

// ReferenceError
console.log(z);  // z is not defined
```

let is block scoped 

let wont allow - redeclaration of variable
var will allow - redeclaration of variable - value will be updated

let and const are hoisted 

var statements and function declarations at the top level of a script create properties of the global object. On the other hand, let and const declarations never create properties of the global object.

let - const - hoisted - block scope 
- main purpose : define the scope 
- TDZ - zone from start of block till where declarations are present 
- ref error is thrown 


benefits: avoid errors like in var ( shadowing , redeclaration )


in javascript , let and const are hoisted . are var not ?

1. `var` declarations are hoisted:
   - The declaration is moved to the top of its scope.
   - The variable is initialized with `undefined`.

2. `let` and `const` declarations are hoisted differently:
   - The declarations are moved to the top of their block scope.
   - However, they are not initialized.
   - This creates a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is reached.

So while `let` and `const` are technically hoisted, they behave differently from `var`. You can't access `let` and `const` variables before their declaration in the code, whereas you can access `var` variables (though they'll be `undefined`).

Here's a quick example to illustrate:

```javascript
console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined
var x = 5;

console.log(y); // Throws ReferenceError
let y = 10;
```

Would you like me to explain this concept further or provide more examples?
