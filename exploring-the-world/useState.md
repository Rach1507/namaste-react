Why can't we use Normal variable instead of state variable. Reason one. Yak doesnt keep a track of Normal variables I don't want to know It wont If it wont know When the normal variables are updated Also If we are updating The state variable. How are we using constant there? Answer is Every time the state update happens The whole component is Rerendered That means that particular function is called, and it's a new variable. The constant. datas or set data Both are new variables. Will the whole component be landed? Only a part of it rendered. The whole component is called, but I'm not sure what is painted.
